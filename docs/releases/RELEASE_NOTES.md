# Release Notes

## Release 0.9.2

### Version
0.9.2

### Date
2026-07-02

### Summary
Release 0.9.2 cleans up the repository documentation structure after the Release 0.9.1 engineering foundation. It is documentation-only and prepares the repository guidance for Release 1.0.

### Updates
- Archived the superseded `docs/development` baseline under `docs/archive/development-baseline`.
- Consolidated active engineering guidance under `docs/process`.
- Verified README entry points and updated AGENTS, master index, planning, release, and process cross-references.
- Updated planning state to show v0.9.0 and v0.9.1 released, v0.9.2 in progress, and Release 1.0 next.

### Validation
- Required validation: `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run build`, and `git diff --check`.

### Known Issues
- Historical audit documents still describe the repository state as of June 27, 2026 and should remain archived as historical findings.

## Release 0.9.1

### Version
0.9.1

### Date
2026-07-02

### Summary
Release 0.9.1 establishes the permanent Family OS engineering framework. It is a documentation and process release only; it does not add application features.

### Updates
- Updated `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, master documentation index, AI instructions, architecture overview, roadmap, project status, current sprint, changelog, and release notes to point future work at `docs/process`.
- Added `eslint` as a direct dev dependency after validation found the existing lint script was not portable in a clean pnpm worktree.

### Validation
- Required validation: `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run build`, and `git diff --check`.

### Known Issues
- The process framework should be refined after it is used on the next release workstream.

### Release Status
Released as v0.9.1.

## Release 0.9

### Version
0.9

### Date
2026-07-02

### Summary
Release 0.9 adds the household collaboration foundation: secure household invitations, authenticated accept/decline flows, active household switching, and Settings-based member management.

### New Features
- Hashed-token household invitations with create, preview, accept, decline, and revoke lifecycle flows.
- Invite token preservation through auth redirects via `?invite=...`.
- Active household switching backed by `user_preferences.default_household_id`.
- Settings household directory, pending invites, invite creation, revoke controls, and owner-only role/remove management.

### Validation
- Disposable local Supabase only; production was not touched.
- Full schema plus ordered migration chain applied cleanly from an empty local validation database with a minimal Supabase auth harness.
- Release 0.9 migration re-run passed with expected idempotency notices.
- Schema/RLS/RPC assertions passed for invitation table, token-hash-only storage, constraints, indexes, RLS, owner policies, and invitation RPC signatures.
- Browser smoke tests passed on `http://localhost:3002` with local disposable users for owner, adult, and viewer flows.
- `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run build`, and `git diff --check` passed during release validation.

### Fixes
- Allowed the Release 0.6C auth ownership baseline migration to run on empty local/staging databases while preserving the approved-owner guard when existing module rows require backfill.
- Added `extensions` to Release 0.9 invitation RPC search paths so `pgcrypto.digest` resolves in local and Supabase-style schemas.
- Hid owner-only member role/remove and pending invite controls from non-owner Settings views.

### Known Issues
- Public sign-up remains deferred; invited users still need valid Supabase auth accounts for the invited email.
- Ownership transfer and owner recovery remain deferred.
- Broad household-scoped RLS conversion for existing module tables remains deferred.
- Deployed Google OAuth validation and legacy browser calendar fallback removal remain separate Release 0.8 follow-up work.

### Recommendation
Released as v0.9.0.

## Release 0.6B

### Version
0.6B

### Date
2026-07-01

### Summary
Release 0.6B delivers the first usable Family OS dashboard for family testing. It turns the Home tab into a command center, improves Google Calendar visibility, adds local family member management, replaces the legacy task screen with a task MVP, hardens mobile UX, and adds Settings/Profile.

### New Features
- Dashboard command center with action groups, module status cards, family overview, schedule, recent activity, notes, skeletons, and empty states.
- Google Calendar dashboard pass with signed-out/syncing/synced/empty/error states, today/upcoming grouping, source labels, and last-sync visibility.
- Family member management with editable local members, roles, colors, active/inactive state, assignment filters, and reference-aware removal/deactivation.
- Task management MVP with create, edit, complete, reopen, delete, reassign, filters, sorting, dashboard task groups, toast feedback, and delete confirmation.
- Settings/Profile screen with signed-in profile details, household defaults, task defaults, calendar connection controls, local metadata visibility, sign out, and confirmed local app data reset.

### Fixes
- Hardened malformed Google Calendar events, invalid sync timestamps, malformed task records, incomplete family records, and missing localStorage records.
- Improved keyboard focus visibility, task drawer labels, toast live-region semantics, mobile action wrapping, and responsive app header behavior.
- Preserved the existing browser popup Google OAuth flow and Supabase-compatible task persistence.

### Database Changes
- None.

### Known Issues
- Family members, settings, and task metadata fields not present in the applied Supabase schema are stored in browser localStorage for Release 0.6B.
- Google Calendar access tokens are still stored in browser localStorage; future work should move calendar connection storage server-side.
- `useTable` still masks Supabase read/write failures with seed/local fallback behavior.
- Bottom navigation now has six items and should be verified on physical mobile devices before broad family testing.

### Next Priorities
- Release 0.6B stability testing on real mobile and desktop browsers.
- Household/family member schema migration.
- Shared task schema migration for assignee, status, created/completed timestamps, and module ownership.
- Server-side calendar connection model and token storage.
- Release candidate tag and merge after family test sign-off.
