# Release Notes

## Release 0.6B

### Version
0.6B

### Date
2026-07-01

### Summary
Release 0.6B delivers the first usable Family OS dashboard for family testing. It turns the Home tab into a command center, improves Google Calendar visibility, adds local family member management, replaces the legacy task screen with a task MVP, hardens mobile UX, and adds Settings/Profile.

### New Features
- Dashboard command center with action groups, module status cards, family overview, schedule, recent activity, notes, skeletons, and empty states.
- Google Calendar dashboard pass with signed-out/syncing/synced/empty/error states, today/upcoming grouping, source labels, and last-sync visibility.
- Family member management with editable local members, roles, colors, active/inactive state, assignment filters, and reference-aware removal/deactivation.
- Task management MVP with create, edit, complete, reopen, delete, reassign, filters, sorting, dashboard task groups, toast feedback, and delete confirmation.
- Settings/Profile screen with signed-in profile details, household defaults, task defaults, calendar connection controls, local metadata visibility, sign out, and confirmed local app data reset.

### Fixes
- Hardened malformed Google Calendar events, invalid sync timestamps, malformed task records, incomplete family records, and missing localStorage records.
- Improved keyboard focus visibility, task drawer labels, toast live-region semantics, mobile action wrapping, and responsive app header behavior.
- Preserved the existing browser popup Google OAuth flow and Supabase-compatible task persistence.

### Database Changes
- None.

### Known Issues
- Family members, settings, and task metadata fields not present in the applied Supabase schema are stored in browser localStorage for Release 0.6B.
- Google Calendar access tokens are still stored in browser localStorage; future work should move calendar connection storage server-side.
- `useTable` still masks Supabase read/write failures with seed/local fallback behavior.
- Bottom navigation now has six items and should be verified on physical mobile devices before broad family testing.

### Next Priorities
- Release 0.6B stability testing on real mobile and desktop browsers.
- Household/family member schema migration.
- Shared task schema migration for assignee, status, created/completed timestamps, and module ownership.
- Server-side calendar connection model and token storage.
- Release candidate tag and merge after family test sign-off.
