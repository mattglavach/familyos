# Changelog

## Unreleased
- Added the app-level household context provider, hook, and Supabase household service as the foundation for future `household_id` module migrations.
- Improved authentication UX with action-specific loading states, stricter email validation, clearer password reset confirmation, and an expired reset-link screen.
- Added household foundation local-only migration setup documentation and Sprint 1 report; local migration apply remains blocked pending Docker Desktop, Supabase CLI, and `psql`.
- Created a local-only household foundation migration file under `supabase/migrations/` without applying it.
- Added a Supabase password reset flow with approved-email validation, reset email delivery, and an in-app password update screen for recovery sessions.
- Migrated PoolBrief and RetirementBrief UI to shared AI brief panel helpers while preserving AI prompts, history, refresh, copy, and follow-up behavior.
- Migrated app header, bottom navigation, and global loading wrapper to shared UI primitives/classes while preserving routing and auth/calendar actions.
- Migrated AuthGate and SetupRequired to shared card, form, button, input, section header, and status badge primitives while preserving auth behavior.
- Migrated QuickAdd UI to the shared drawer, form primitives, segmented controls, chips, and Lucide icons while preserving existing save behavior.
- Added Phase 1 UI migration primitives for forms, segmented controls, chips, section headers, empty states, and status badges without changing feature screen behavior.
- Made email/password the primary Supabase login path for the private household app while keeping magic links as a fallback.
- Refactored the React app into a modular source structure with src/app, src/modules, src/hooks, and src/utils while preserving current behavior.
- Added resend cooldown and friendly rate-limit messaging to Supabase email magic-link sign-in.
- Documented Google Calendar OAuth origin setup for localhost, Vercel production, custom domains, and preview deployments.
- Added a clearer Google Calendar `origin_mismatch` diagnostic that reports the current app origin to add in Google Cloud Console.
- Clarified Supabase magic-link redirect configuration and kept email sign-in redirects tied to the current app origin.
- Fixed Vercel production build failure by clearing CRA ESLint warnings that are treated as errors in CI.
